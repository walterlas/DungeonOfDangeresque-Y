Dungeon of Danger (+) in Yab

I feel like I'm a bit obsessed with Dungeon of Danger. I've done a version for Python 3 and
then started to make a "plus" version (which is still in progress, but I'm having trouble doing
it in Python). And now there's this one for Yab on Haiku.

There will be two versions, I think: a command line version and a GUI version. 

Technically, I think the command line version will work with any Yabasic, although it won't
have pretty colors and all, since the Haiku one is compiled with ncurses by default. And I 
don't feel like fussing with it.
